'''
Day 16: Exceptions - String to Integer
Task
Read a string, S, and print its integer value; if S cannot be converted
to an integer, print Bad String.

Sample Input 0:
3

Sample Output 0:
3

Sample Input 1:
za

Sample Output 1:
Bad String


Explanation
Sample Case 0 contains an integer 3, so it should not raise an exception when
we attempt to convert it to an integer. Thus, we print the 3.
Sample Case 1 does not contain any integers, so an attempt to convert it to an
integer will raise an exception. Thus, our exception handler prints Bad String.
